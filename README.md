# portfolio
This is my portfolio staring page. I wanted a base to introduce myself, to show off my projects and learning. Early stages consist of basic framework and placeholders to fill in later as I develop more projects. Plans to remake and add my resume along with adding more images of myself and hobbies.

Current status: Page made, themes added, about me section, card for future projects, contacts and email form.
